# 🤖 Career Recommendation AI  
*A Web-Based AI Agent for Skill-Based Career Guidance*

---

## 🌟 Project Overview

Choosing the right career path is often challenging due to a lack of personalized guidance based on individual skills. Many students and professionals possess valuable skills but are unsure which career roles align best with their strengths.

**Career Recommendation AI** is a web-based AI agent that analyzes user-provided skills and intelligently recommends suitable career paths. The system uses rule-based artificial intelligence and basic natural language processing concepts to match skills with real-world career roles.

This project was developed as part of the **IBM SkillsBuild Winter Certification Program – Applied Artificial Intelligence**, focusing on building a functional, interactive AI agent with real-world relevance.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students and early professionals often struggle to identify appropriate career options despite having relevant skills. Traditional career guidance systems are either generic, expensive, or inaccessible, leading to confusion and poor career decisions.

There is a need for a **simple, accessible, and interactive AI-based solution** that can:
- Understand user skills
- Analyze them intelligently
- Recommend relevant career paths in real time

## ✅ Solution

The Career Recommendation AI addresses this problem by:
- Accepting user skills through an intuitive web interface
- Processing the input using rule-based AI logic
- Matching skills with predefined career requirements
- Displaying ranked career recommendations instantly

The system acts as a **decision-support AI agent** that helps users gain clarity about suitable career options.
